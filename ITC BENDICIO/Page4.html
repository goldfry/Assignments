<h1> Dumaguete Oslob Whaleshark Tour </h1>
<img src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-720x480/07/94/4a/78.jpg" alt="Dumaguete Oslob Whaleshark Tour" class="center">
<p>Travel from Dumaguete to Cebu and meet up with a friendly driver who will take you to Oslob, home of what locals call the "butanding".<br>
 This slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark is one of the largest known fish species - and a true sight to behold. You will not only<br>
 get to snorkel and swim with the whale sharks, but also participate in the feeding. Since whale shark encounters are only allowed during<br>
 the morning (6:30am to 12:30pm), it's best to head out to Cebu early. Arrive at 7:30am at the Liloan Port where your driver will pick you<br>
 up and take you for a scenic drive along the Southern Cebu coastline. Once you arrive in Oslob, get your snorkeling gear (provided if you<br>
 chose the Swimming Fee Snorkeling with Whale Sharks Add-On) and dive in the water for your whale shark encounter.</p>
